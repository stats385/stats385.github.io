## Data-dependent Regularization and Sample Complexity of Deep Neural Networks

In this talk, we study the regularization for deep learning. First, we show that for a simple data distribution, training neural network with an l_2 regularization has provably better sample complexity than the Kernel method with random feature kernel or the neural tangent kernel (NTK). Second, we improve the sample complexity bounds of deep neural networks by introducing a complexity measure of the hypothesis that depends on the training data. Adding the complexity measure as a regularizer also leads to empirically better generalization performance.
