<strong><a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/"> Yoshua Bengio </a></strong>

<img style="float: right; width: 175px; margin-left: 20px" src="/assets/img/bengio.jpg">

<p align="justify">
A computer scientist, most noted for his work on artificial neural networks and deep learning.
He has contributed to a wide spectrum of machine learning areas and is well known for his theoretical results on recurrent neural networks, kernel machines, distributed representations, depth of neural architectures, and the optimization challenge of deep learning.
His work was crucial in advancing how deep networks are trained, how neural networks can learn vector embeddings for words, how to perform machine translation with deep learning by taking advantage of an attention mechanism, and how to perform unsupervised learning with deep generative models.<br />

<strong><a href="http://www.andrewng.org/"> Andrew Ng </a></strong>

<img style="float: right; width: 175px; margin-left: 20px" src="/assets/img/ng.jpeg">

<p align="justify">
A computer scientist, whose research is on machine learning and AI, with an emphasis on deep learning.
In 2011, Ng founded the Google Brain project at Google, which developed very large scale artificial neural networks using Google's distributed computer infrastructure.
Among its notable results was a neural network trained using deep learning algorithms on 16,000 CPU cores, that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, after watching only YouTube videos, and without ever having been told what a "cat" is.<br />
