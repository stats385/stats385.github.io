## Grading methodology
The grade in this course will be based on two factors:

#### Q&A participation: 35/100

During the quarter we will have 7 guest lectures, during which students can post questions on Canvas and obtain 5/100 points for a maximum of 35/100 points. The goal is to stimulate discussion in class, encourage critical thinking and provide feedback for the presenters.

#### Reviewing paper: 65/100â€¨
Each student is required to write a minimum two-page review of a theoretical paper in the area of deep learning including, but not limited to, those discussed in this class. In particular, your review should include a brief summary of the paper followed by your critique. The deadline for submitting the review is December 16.

## Passing grade
The passing grade is 80/100, which amounts to summarizing a paper and participating in the Q&A of 3 lectures.
