## Machine Learning: A Robustness Perspective

Machine learning has made tremendous progress over the last decade. However, these leaps in performance have mostly focused on average, or even best case, performance.

How well do modern machine learning methods perform from more of a worst case perspective?

In this talk I will discuss the challenges behind making ML systems robust, reliable, and secure. I will start by surveying the widespread vulnerabilities of state-of-the-art ML models in adversarial settings. Then, I will outline both promising approaches for alleviating these deficiencies and our current understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of ML robustness.
