# Analyses of Deep Learning

Deep learning is a transformative technology that has delivered impressive improvements in image classification and speech recognition. Many researchers are trying to better understand how to improve prediction performance and also how to improve training methods. Some researchers use experimental techniques; others use theoretical approaches. In this course we will review both experimental and theoretical analyses of deep learning. We will have 8-10 guest lecturers as well as graded projects for those who take the course for credit.
